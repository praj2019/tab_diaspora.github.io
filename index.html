            Tamil Nadu is a state in southern India. It is the home of 
            the Tamil people, whose Tamil language—one of the longest 
            surviving classical languages in the world—is widely spoken 
            in the state and serves as its official language.

                The region of Tamil Nadu in the southeast of modern India, shows 
                evidence of having had continuous human habitation from 15,000 BCE to 
                10,000 BCE.[1][2] Throughout its history, spanning the early Upper 
                Paleolithic age to modern times, this region has coexisted with various 
                external cultures. The three ancient Tamil dynasties namely Chera, Chola,
                 and Pandya were of ancient origins. Together they ruled over this land 
                 with a unique culture and language, contributing to the growth of some 
                 of the oldest extant literature in the world.

                The trauma of the partition did not impact Tamil Nadu when India was 
                granted Independence in 1947. There was no sectarian violence against 
                various religions. There had always been an atmosphere of mutual respect
                and peaceful coexistence between all religions in Tamil Nadu.The Madras 
                state was named Tamil Nadu (literally The Land of Tamils or Tamil Country)
                in 1969.

                Tamils have strong attachment to the Tamil language, which is often venerated in literature as "Tamil̲an̲n̲ai", "the Tamil mother". 
                It has historically been, and to large extent still is, central to the Tamil identity. Like the other languages of South India, it is 
                unrelated to the Indo-European languages of northern India. The Tamil language preserves many features of Proto-Dravidian.
                Tamil literature is of considerable antiquity, and is recognised as a classical language by the government of India. 
                Classical Tamil literature, which ranges from lyric poetry to works on poetics and ethical philosophy, is remarkably different
                from contemporary and later literature in other Indian languages, and represents the oldest body of secular literature in South-east Asia.
